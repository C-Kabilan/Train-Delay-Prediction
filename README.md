Train delays are a common issue that disrupts transportation efficiency, affecting passengers and logistics operations. This project aims to develop a Train Delay Prediction System using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network, a type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) suitable for time-series forecasting. The objective is to predict potential train delays based on various real-time and historical factors such as weather conditions, time of day, day of the week, train type, and route congestion.
The methodology follows a structured approach:
1.	Data Preprocessing – The dataset is cleaned by handling missing values using forward fill, and categorical features are converted into numerical representations using Label Encoding.
2.	Feature Scaling – The MinMaxScaler is applied to normalize numerical values, ensuring better LSTM model performance.
3.	Sequence Generation – Time-series data is structured into overlapping sequences for LSTM model input.
4.	Model Development – A deep learning model with LSTM layers, dropout regularization, and dense layers is designed for delay prediction. The model is trained using the Adam optimizer with Mean Squared Error (MSE) as the loss function.
5.	Evaluation & Visualization – The model is assessed using Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R² score. Visualizations such as loss curves, actual vs. predicted delay plots, and error distribution histograms provide insights into model performance.
The trained model demonstrates reliable accuracy in predicting train delays, aiding railway authorities in real-time decision-making. By improving transport efficiency and scheduling, this system contributes to enhancing passenger experience and operational effectiveness. Future enhancements may include real-time data integration and hybrid deep-learning models for improved accuracy.
